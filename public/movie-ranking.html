 <h1>The best movies according to Benjamin</h1>
    <h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
        <h3>The Avengers Endgame</h3>
            <p>This is my favorite movie. Love all the action!</p>
        <h3>Superman vs Batman</h3>
            <p>
                One of the best movies. <br /> 
                I was always wanting to see Superman fights Batman!
            </p>
        <h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
            <p>
                Love this movie, because in this movie all three Spidermans from other dimentions are meeting <br />
                and fighting their own animies together
